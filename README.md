# IoT Edge Device Setup â€“ Azure Integration

This project involves setting up and configuring a real-world industrial IoT edge device for remote monitoring via Azure Cloud.

## Tools Used
- Azure IoT Hub
- Modbus TCP
- Mosquitto (MQTT Broker)
- PostgreSQL
- Docker / Linux CLI

## Description
I worked on configuring an edge device running multiple containers, including Modbus for data collection, Mosquitto for messaging, and PostgreSQL for data storage. The data was then pushed to Azure using IoT Hub for visualization and analysis.

## My Role
- Set up and tested containerized services on the device
- Verified Modbus communication with RTUs
- Ensured smooth data flow from edge to Azure
